Phalanger, common name for certain marsupial mammals found in Australia, New Guinea, Tasmania, the Solomon Islands, the Moluccas, and Sulawesi. Phalangers have also been introduced into New Zealand. The family of phalangers contains a number of widely differing species, ranging in length from about 32 to 65 cm (13 to 26 in). All the members of the family have five toes on each foot. Four of these toes have large claws; the innermost toe is opposable and has no claw. Phalangers are nocturnal, arboreal animals that feed chiefly on fruit and leaves. Some species feed also on nectar, insects, and, occasionally, small birds.

The typical phalangers, or cuscuses, have dense, woolly fur and long, prehensile tails. Most of them are large animals, up to 60 cm (up to 24 in) long. They nest in hollow trees and clumps of vegetation. The best-known species is the spotted cuscus, which is chiefly creamy white in color, with spots of chestnut and black on the back, and with gray or reddish-brown legs. The vulpine phalangers are characterized by foxlike faces.

Although it is often called a koala bear, the koala is not at all related to bears. It lives in eucalyptus trees and its only food is eucalyptus leaves. It feeds at night and spends all day asleep in a tree. Female koalas have one baby at a time. This spends more than six months in its motherâ€™s pouch then climbs out and rides on her back.

Colocolo, also known as Monito del monte, small, opossum-like marsupial. Although harmless, these animals are thought by some to bring bad luck. Colocolos inhabit a small area in South America, ranging from southern Chile eastward to the mountainous border of Argentina. They are also found on Chiloé Island off the coast of Chile. Colocolos are arboreal (live in trees) and prefer cool, humid forests, especially where Chilean bamboo is abundant.

These small marsupials measure about 12 cm (5 in) in length, not including their thick, furry tail, which is 10 cm (4 in) long. The color of their short, silky fur ranges from dark brown to white, typically with dark and light patches and whorls distributed over the shoulders and back. Colocolos have short, furry ears, a relatively short snout, and distinctive dark rings around the eyes. 

Colocolos eat insects and other invertebrates. They search for food at night. In winter, when food becomes scarce, they enter a dormant condition called hibernation.

Colocolos are capable of reproducing in the second year of life, and they breed in the spring. After mating, parents prepare for their young by building small nests on the ground made of sticks, Chilean bamboo leaves, grass, and moss. One to five young are born and continue developing in the mother’s pouch, where they attach to a mammary gland nipple to feed. Older young live in the nest and venture out for trips on their mother’s back. Soon they are able to scamper around on their own.

While not widely known outside of South America, colocolos are common in many parts of its small range. Once classified as a member of the opossum family, colocolos are now classified as the only living member of a family of marsupials that inhabited southern South America 26 million years ago.

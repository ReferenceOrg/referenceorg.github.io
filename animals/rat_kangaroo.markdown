Rat-Kangaroo, rodentlike marsupial native to Australia. Scientists recognize four types of rat-kangaroos: musky rat-kangaroos, potoroos, bettongs, and rufous bettongs. These animals are relatives of—and probably ancestors to—the kangaroos.

Rat-kangaroos occupy a wide variety of habitats throughout Australia and on nearby islands. Some live in dry plains and deserts, while others live in grasslands or forests. The musky rat-kangaroo lives in the rainforest along the northeastern coast.

Rat-kangaroos range in size from 24 to 52 cm (9 to 20 in), not including the tail. They weigh between 0.5 and 3 kg (1 and 7 lb). Their brown or gray fur is lighter on the belly. With the exception of the musky rat-kangaroo, these animals have short front legs and long rear legs, which they use for leaping. As in true kangaroos, two of the toes on the rear feet are especially long and aid in hopping. They use their heavy, muscular tail for balancing. The musky rat-kangaroo is more mouselike in appearance, with a slender naked tail and small front and rear feet.

The rat-kangaroo’s diet is made up of plant leaves, stems, and roots. Their molars are specialized for grinding plant matter, and they have saclike stomachs, similar to those of cows and other ruminants, which enable them to digest tough plant material. The musky rat-kangaroo is the only rat-kangaroo with a simple stomach. It eats mainly insects and worms. Potoroos, betongs, and rufous bettongs are active mainly at night, whereas musky rat-kangaroos are active mainly during the day.

All types of rat-kangaroos use their mouths, hands, and tails to build nests out of grass and sticks. The gestation period of the musky rat-kangaroo is unknown, but for other rat-kangaroo females it lasts between 21 and 42 days. After gestation is complete, the young rat-kangaroo emerges from the birth canal and climbs into its mother’s pouch, where it remains for 90 to 120 days. Rat-kangaroos produce only one young at a time, with the exception of the musky rat-kangaroo, which typically produces two young. Rat-kangaroos are generally solitary animals.

Human settlement, logging, and destruction of grasslands by domestic grazing animals and rabbits have reduced the habitat available to rat-kangaroos. Predation, especially by foxes and cats, has also impacted these once abundant animals. As a result of these threats, three species of bettongs and one species of potoroo are considered endangered. One of the bettong species, commonly known as the boodie, became extinct on the mainland and until recently could be found only on three of Australia’s offshore islands. A joint project involving the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management and Earth Sanctuaries Limited of South Australia has reintroduced boodies to a sanctuary on the mainland in South Australia. A variety of sanctuaries have been created to protect other rat-kangaroo species.

Scientific classification: Rat-kangaroos are the only members of the subfamily Potoroinae in the kangaroo family, Macropodidae, of the order Marsupialia. The musky rat-kangaroo is classified as Hypsiprymnodon moschatus. The boodie is classified as Bettongia lesueur; the two other endangered betongs are classified as Bettongia penicillata and Bettongia tropica. The endangered potoroo species is classified as Potorous longipes.

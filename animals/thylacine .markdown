Thylacine or Tasmanian Wolf, carnivorous marsupial that recently inhabited Tasmania. The animal was the size of a small wolf, and it looked like a dog except for the rather stiff tail and tapered hind end. The hair was short and coarse, and the generally brownish color was distinctively marked with black stripes across the back. This species is now extinct.

Scientific classification: The thylacine makes up the family Thylacinidae. It is classified as Thylacinus cynocephalus.

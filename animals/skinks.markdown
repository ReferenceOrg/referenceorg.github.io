Skink, common name for any member of a large family of lizards found worldwide. There are about 100 genera of skinks and more than 1000 species. Most are small to medium-sized—no more than 12 cm (5 in) long, excluding the tail—but some Australasian skinks are about 50 cm (about 19 in) long. Skinks usually have cylindrical bodies, a pointed head, and shiny overlapping scales. Their legs are often well developed for walking and running, although in some burrowing species the limbs are reduced or even absent.

Skinks readily lose their tails to escape predators. They do so without blood loss, and their tails are regrown afterward. Most skinks are terrestrial, foraging by day and taking shelter at night under stones, logs, or other debris. Insects and other arthropods are their chief prey, but the larger skinks also eat fruit, snails, or even nestling rodents and birds. Some skinks lay eggs, and others give birth to live young. Skinks usually produce two to six eggs or young at a time. Some guard their eggs against predators throughout incubation.

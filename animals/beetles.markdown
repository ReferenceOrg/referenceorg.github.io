### Introduction

Beetle, insect belonging to the order Coleoptera, the largest group of animals on Earth. Beetles represent more than a third of all known insect species, and a fourth of all animal species. Scientists have identified about 350,000 species of beetles, but experts estimate that for every known species there are several more species that have not yet been discovered and named. Some experts estimate that there could be more than 8 million species of beetles worldwide. When asked whether his study of nature had provided any insights into the mind of the Creator, British scientist J. B. S. Haldane reportedly responded that God must have “an inordinate fondness for beetles.” 

Beetles have evolved over 230 million years to form one of the most successful groups of insects. They have widely diverse shapes, sizes, and colors and they live in almost all parts of the world except the oceans, Arctic regions, and Antarctica. Beetles are especially successful in tropical habitats, but they can also be found in frigid mountainous habitats as well as in some of the hottest, driest deserts.

### Physical Characteristics

Coleoptera, the scientific name of the beetle order, comes from the Greek words coleos (“sheath”) and pteron (“wing”). The term refers to the characteristic feature of beetles—hardened front wings that form a protective sheath over the hind pair of flying wings. While most beetles can fly, many are clumsy fliers, and some have lost the ability to fly and live primarily on the ground.

Most beetle species live on land, but some spend part or all of their lives in water. Others tunnel underground, in wood, or in the carcasses of animals. Some beetles live in the nests of ants and termites, forming a mutually beneficial relationship. The nest protects the beetles from predators, and the ants or termites receive house-cleaning services as the beetles consume the waste products of the colony.

The beetle diet varies widely. Many beetles feed on plants, and each species usually prefers a particular plant species. Beetles feed on various parts of a plant, anything from the roots to the flowers. Many beetles are scavengers and eat dead plant or animal matter. Others are predatory, preying on insects, snails, or other small invertebrates.

About 100 species of beetles are considered some of the most destructive of all insect pests, due to their widespread distribution and varied feeding habits. Worldwide each year beetles cause millions of dollars in damage to plant products, such as food crops or timber, by feeding on them or by transmitting fungi and other agents of disease. One of the best-known beetle pests is the Colorado potato beetle. It became a pest in the middle of the 19th century, when settlers introduced potatoes into the beetle’s native range. Farmers find it difficult to control potato beetle infestations because the insects quickly develop resistance to insecticides. Another common pest in gardens and on a wide variety of crops is the Japanese beetle. Accidentally imported from Japan to the United States in 1916, the Japanese beetle feeds on over 400 species of broad-leaved plants. The beetle eats the tissue between the veins of leaves, giving the attacked leaves a lacelike appearance before they wither and die. Another well-known destructive beetle is the boll weevil, which spread into Texas from Central America in 1892. Boll weevils destroy cotton crops in the United States and elsewhere.

Many other types of beetles are beneficial to humans. Farmers release certain beetles in their fields to control insect pests. For example, ladybird beetles feed upon aphids and other small sucking insects that injure food crops, and ground beetles feed on crop-damaging potato beetles and caterpillars that destroy trees and shrubs.

### Bodies of Beetles

#### Body Covering

The beetle's cuticle, or body covering, provides a tough, waterproof sheath that protects the soft inner organs and provides a rigid framework for the attachment of muscles. Harder and thicker than that of most other insects, the beetle’s cuticle is composed mainly of chitin, a strong, flexible compound. The cuticle restricts movement, and some beetles have difficulty righting themselves when turned upside down on a smooth surface. An exception is the click beetle, named for the clicking noise the beetle makes when it springs into the air to right itself.

The cuticle is commonly shiny brown or black, often with intricate texture patterns, but it may be brightly colored, or have colored spots, stripes, or other color patterns. Cuticle color in beetles derives from natural pigments in the animal tissue, which provide the many earth tones exhibited by beetles. In some species, minute surface structures refract light of various wavelengths, producing bright metallic or iridescent shades.

#### Head

The beetle’s head bears the antennae, eyes, and mouthparts. The antennae function as feelers, helping the beetle navigate and find food and potential mates. In some species the antennae may serve other purposes as well—for instance, the large antennae of some longhorned beetles help maintain balance. Beetle antennae generally consist of 11 segments, and the segments can take a variety of shapes, including cylindrical, beadlike, sawtoothed, club-shaped, or fan-shaped. Scientists use the shape of a beetle’s antennae as one means of classifying or identifying it.

Like other insects beetles have compound eyes, which are divided into many six-sided compartments called ommatidia. The ommatidia extend around the sides of the beetle’s head, providing a wide field of vision. Compound eyes produce blurred images of distant objects, but they are very sensitive to movement. Recent investigations of the structure of the beetle’s compound eye suggest that some beetles can see in color.

Beetles have chewing mouthparts that move from side to side rather than up and down in the manner of human chewing. Beetle mouthparts consist of four main components: the labrum (upper lip), a pair of mandibles (front jaws), a pair of jointed maxillae (back jaws), and the labium (lower lip). The shape and size of beetle mouthparts vary from species to species depending on the food preferences of the species. For instance, predatory beetles have extended mandibles that can seize, cut, or crush prey. Beetles that consume nectar from flowers use tubelike mouthparts to suck up nectar like a primitive straw.

#### Thorax

The thorax, the body region behind the head, consists of three segments that provide attachments for the legs and wings. Each segment of the thorax carries a pair of legs. The middle segment also bears the stiff wing sheaths called elytra, and the hind segment holds the membranous hind wings. 

#### Legs

Beetles have six jointed legs, each leg with five parts. The fifth part is the foot, or tarsus, which itself has three to five segments known as tarsomeres. The number of tarsomeres present helps scientists identify beetle families. In some species, from one to four of the tarsomeres have an adhesive pad on the bottom, which enables beetles to walk up walls, windows, plant stems, and other vertical surfaces. The last segment of the foot bears a pair of claws. 

Beetle legs may be modified for various life styles. Swift runners, like the ground beetles, have long and slender legs. Swimming beetles, such as true water beetles, have curved, paddlelike legs, and dung beetles use their broad legs for digging.

#### Wings

Most beetles have two types of wings—elytra and hind wings. Beetles use only their hind wings for flight. The hind wings typically fold to fit under the elytra when not in use. In some beetle species that live on the ground, the hind wings may be missing altogether. 
 
The elytra cover the abdomen when the insect is not in flight. The two elytra meet in the middle of the abdomen, forming a characteristic straight line down the abdomen. The elytra protect beetles from drying out, from predators that bite, and from other kinds of damage. Many of the beetles that do not fly have fused elytra that insulate the abdomen and protect the insect from extreme heat or extreme cold. 

As a beetle prepares to fly, it opens the elytra, unfolds its hind wings, and uses its legs to jump into the air. Muscles embedded in the thorax enable the wings to beat. Some beetles can open their wings and jump into the air from a flat surface. Larger beetle species must climb onto a plant or other platform for takeoff or sit in the sun to warm their thoracic muscles before they are able to take off and fly. Beetles active primarily at night must vibrate their thoracic muscles to help raise the body temperature before flight is possible.

#### Abdomen

Behind the beetle’s thorax is its abdomen, which is divided into a number of segments. The elytra cover the top of the abdomen. Along the sides of the abdomen are external openings, known as spiracles, which are part of the respiratory system. The abdomen houses the digestive and reproductive organs.

#### Sense Organs

The antennae function as the beetle’s main sense organs, receptive to signals of touch, smell, and taste. Beetles use taste and smell receptors on the antennae to locate food and also to identify pheromones, chemical substances released by other beetles of the same species to attract mates. Beetles also have sense organs on their bodies in the form of setae (bristles) that are sensitive to touch, sound, smell, taste, and light. 

Most beetles have a very good sense of smell, which they use to locate food. Scarabs use smell to find piles of dung, their primary food source, and plant-feeding beetles, such as leaf beetles, rely mainly on smell to find the particular species of plants that they feed on. Beetles in general have a poorly developed sense of hearing. They can sense air vibrations caused by sound waves, but they are more sensitive to vibrations in the ground, which they feel through receptors on their legs. Many beetles make peculiar squeaking noises by rubbing parts of the body together, or produce sounds by tapping on hard surfaces. These sound-producing beetles have better hearing than beetles that do not make sounds. Sense receptors also provide beetles with information about body positions, so that a beetle always knows the position of its legs or head in relation to its body.

#### Internal Organs

Like other insects, beetles digest and absorb nutrients from food, expel waste products via an excretory system, and take in oxygen from the air. Digestion occurs in the alimentary canal, a tube extending from the mouth at one end of the body to the anus at the other. 

The heart lies in the thorax, and pumps blood toward the front of the body. Blood does not circulate through veins and arteries but passes freely between and around the body organs. Like all insects, beetles lack lungs. Air passes directly into the body through spiracles, the openings along the abdomen, and then circulates to the tissues by a system of branching tubes. 

The nervous system includes a simple brain made up of ganglia (clusters of nerve cells) lying at the front end of the alimentary canal. From the brain a double nerve cord runs back along the bottom of the body. The nerve cord connects a series of ganglia in the thorax and abdomen. From this nerve cord, nerves extend to sensory cells throughout the body.

The beetle’s reproductive organs lie in the abdomen. The female has a pair of ovaries where eggs develop and tubes called oviducts to carry the eggs away from the ovaries. When she lays her eggs, a tubelike external organ called the ovipositor helps the female position her eggs near food so that hatching larvae will not need to travel far to feed. The male has a pair of testes where sperm is produced and a duct to carry the sperm to the penis. The male’s penis stays inside its body except during copulation. 

### Life Cycle of Beetles

#### Egg

The female beetle lays her eggs in a protected place near a food supply, such as in wood or under the bark of trees, on leaves, or in carcasses of decaying animals. Depending on the species, a female may lay a single egg or a mass of eggs. Most beetle eggs range in size from microscopic to about 2.5 mm (0.1 in), and they are usually white. After laying her eggs, female beetles leave the eggs to hatch on their own. Hatching typically occurs after several days, and the wormlike larva stage emerges. In some beetle species the mother watches over the developing larvae to protect them from predators.

#### Larva

Beetle larvae, also known as grubs, vary in appearance, but most have well-developed heads with chewing mouthparts and three pairs of legs. Many species have a pair of leglike structures at the end of the body that help the larvae move. As the larva grows, it molts (sheds its skin) several times. Each molt yields a progressively larger and more developed larval stage.

Most beetle larvae live on land and can be found in a wide variety of habitats, but some are aquatic. Depending on the species, beetle larvae feed on plants, decaying vegetable or organic matter, or stored food in warehouses. Some prey on other insects or small animals. The adult beetle and the larva differ not only in structure, but often in feeding habits. The larvae of the Japanese beetle, for example, feed on plant roots, whereas the adults feed on foliage and fruits.

#### Pupa

At the end of the larval stage, the larva secretes silky strands to form a cocoon. Inside the cocoon, the larva transforms into the pale, soft pupa. The pupal stage is often referred to as the resting stage of the beetle’s life cycle because externally the pupa appears inactive. In fact, a great deal of activity occurs internally during this stage, as larval tissues break down and reform into adult structures. The changes that occur during the pupal stage include the development of the adult legs, wings, antennae, and reproductive system.

#### Adult

When an adult beetle emerges from the pupal stage, its body is soft and pale. The hardening and coloring of the cuticle may not occur for many hours. During this time the hind wings and elytra, which have formed internally, push to the outside of the body.

Adult male and female beetles may look quite different from each other. In some species males are smaller than females, while in other species the reverse is true. The males and females of many species have different colors, suggesting that beetles of these species use color vision to find mates. Other structures that help scientists differentiate males from females in various species include the antennae, mouthparts, abdomen, and elytra. In some species, the proportion of males to females may be unequal. For instance, there may be as many as 60 female bark beetles for every one male.

Beetles spend more time in the larval and adult stages than most insects do. Wireworms (click beetle larvae) may remain at least 12 years in the larval stage before pupating. The larvae of an Indian species of longhorned beetle have been known to live for ten years in captivity, but the adults are short-lived. The adults of a large species of darkling beetles have been kept alive in a laboratory for nine years. Witnesses have observed one species of jewel beetle (Cypriacis aurulenta), common in the forests of western North America, emerge from a piece of wood furniture built 35 years earlier.

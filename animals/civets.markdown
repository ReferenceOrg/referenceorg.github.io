### Introduction

Civet, common name for about 30 species of somewhat catlike, carnivorous mammals (see Carnivore). Civets are native to the warm regions of Southeast Asia, southern Europe, and Africa. They have a long body about the size of a domestic cat, short legs, a tapered head with small ears, and a long, bushy tail. Generally they are yellowish-tan or grayish, with patterns of black spots or stripes or both. They are nocturnal hunters that prey on small animals, but they may also eat carrion and vegetable matter. Some have partly retractile claws, and two species are semiaquatic. The animals are captured and sometimes raised for the substance, also called civet, that they secrete from their anal glands into a sac under the tail and that humans use in making perfumes. The civets use it to mark territory.

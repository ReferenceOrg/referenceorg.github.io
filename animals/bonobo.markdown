Bonobo or Pygmy Chimpanzee, species of chimpanzee found only in a small region of thick jungle in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. First identified in 1929, bonobos differ from their hot-tempered chimpanzee cousins in that they are less aggressive, more amicable, and enjoy a notably peaceful way of life. 

The bonobo looks similar to the common chimpanzee except that it is shorter, narrower in the chest and hips, and has longer limbs and a more upright posture. Male bonobos average 85 cm (34 in) in height and weigh about 40 kg (about 90 lb). Females stand about 78 cm (31 in) tall and weigh about 30 kg (about 66 lb). The bonobo’s coat is long, fine, and mostly black, with some white at the muzzle. The fur on the crown of the head divides in a natural part. Unlike the common chimpanzee, the facial skin of the bonobo is shiny black, the lips are reddish, and the ears are small and inconspicuous. 

Bonobos spend most of their time in trees, where they construct nests for sleeping. The bonobo eats mainly fruit but also nuts, seeds, young leaves, and insects. It occasionally preys upon monkeys, snakes, and small antelopes. Bonobos live in troops of 30 to 80 animals, which divide into smaller bands for foraging. Bonobos are noted for an egalitarian society in which males do not automatically outrank females in the group, as is common in the primate world. 

Females are able to reproduce by age 11 or 12, and males become sexually mature at age 15. Bonobos mate year-round and frequently. Used for more than reproductive purposes, sex is also used for such social purposes as bonding, easing tensions, and creating alliances. Despite the frequency of mating, the bonobo reproduction rate is rather low—females give birth only every four to six years. After a gestational period of 228 days, the mother gives birth to a single young. The mother takes close care of her child and does not wean it until the end of its fifth year. Young bonobos have a distinctive white tuft of fur on their rumps; until they lose this marker of youth they are treated with tolerance by older animals. 

Bonobos are illegally hunted for food and captured for export, but the destruction of their home forests for lumber, firewood, and agriculture is the most severe threat. Bonobos are listed as endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN).

Scientific Classification: Bonobos belong to the Primate order. Some scientists classify bonobos in the family Pongidae and other scientists place bonobos in the family Hominidae. It is classified as Pan paniscus.

Leaf Insect, also walking leaf, common name for any of several insects that bear enlargements of the legs and abdomen that make them resemble leaves. The insects are found in southern Asia and Australia. The females have large leaflike wings. The insects are green or brown and feed on vegetation; their color and form serve to camouflage them in their native surroundings. They lay hard-shelled, seedlike eggs, the form of which is also deceiving to predators. A typical species is about 9 cm (about 3.5 in) long.

Walkingstick, also stick insect, common name for insect so named because it closely resembles a twig of the plants on which most species of walkingsticks live. The insect's body is long and slender, the legs are also twiglike, and the wings are sometimes absent, sometimes rudimentary, and sometimes leaflike. Walkingsticks are found mostly in tropical climates, where some species are known to grow to a length exceeding 30 cm (12 in).

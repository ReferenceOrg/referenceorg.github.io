Shrew Opossum, also known as rat opossums, family of small, shrew-like marsupials found primarily in forested areas of western South America. Shrew opossums are not well known because they are nocturnal—that is, they are active at night—and most inhabit inaccessible, mountainous regions.

Shrew opossums were more abundant in South America during prehistoric times, but now are confined to the alpine forests and meadows of the Andes mountains from southern Venezuela to Chile. Most species prefer wet, cool habitats at high elevations. 

These small marsupials are between 9 and 14 cm (3.5 to 6 in) long and have a tail that is roughly the same length as their bodies. The tail is covered with bristles of short, stiff hair, but the rest of the body is covered with soft brown or black fur. The hind limbs are larger and more pronounced than the forelimbs. All four feet have five digits, at least two of which have sharp, curved claws. The other digits have blunt nails. Shrew opossums have small, rounded ears, an elongated snout, and small eyes. Their vision is poor, but both their hearing and sense of smell are well developed. 

Unlike most marsupials, the female shrew opossum does not have an abdominal pouch in which to carry her immature young. Females have either four or five nipples on the belly, depending on the species. The immature newborns affix themselves to one of the mother’s nipples, where they remain until they have developed enough to survive for short periods of time on their own. Shrew opossum gestation and litter size are unknown.

Shrew opossums spend most of their time on the ground, feeding on insects, spiders, grubs, and other invertebrates. The species best known to scientists has also been observed eating baby rodents and birds. Although they are primarily terrestrial, shrew opossums are also excellent climbers; their sharp claws and the bristles on their tails prevent them from slipping.

Scientific classification: Shrew opossums are the only members of the family Caenolestidae in the order Marsupialia. The best-known species is classified as Caenolestes fuliginosus.

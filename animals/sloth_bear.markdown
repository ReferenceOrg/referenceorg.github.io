Sloth Bear, common name for a bear with very shaggy, long fur; a rather flattened head; and a large, whitish, U- or V-shaped patch on its chest. The name derives from the bear's slow movements. The sloth bear ranges throughout the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka.

Sloth bears grow to about 1.8 m (6 ft) and weigh 54 to 140 kg (119 to 310 lb), depending on the time of year. Sloth bears are well-adapted for extracting insects, especially termites, from holes: The five claws on each foot are very long, to help in digging; the hair on the face is short; the lips and snout are flexible; and the nostrils can close.

Little is known about the sloth bear's reproductive habits. Breeding may occur mostly in April, and the young are born in early winter. Young sloth bears often ride on their mothers' backs, clinging to the long hair. The mothers can be aggressive, but they seldom pose a real threat. The young stay with their mothers at least until the second year. Except for family groups, sloth bears are solitary.

In Sri Lanka, sloth bears are almost extinct; in many parts of India, their status is precarious. Their fondness for fruits can deplete the local supply. Like the Asiatic black bear, they are hunted for their gall bladders and other body parts. Research and conservation efforts have been limited. Their small range makes them more vulnerable than most other bears.

Scientific classification: The sloth bear belongs to the family Ursidae in the order Carnivora. It is classified as Melursus ursinus.

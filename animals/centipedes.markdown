Centipede, common name for the members of a class of the arthropod phylum. The centipedes are long, segmented animals with jointed appendages and a poisonous “bite” that in some species is dangerous to humans. Centipedes are often confused with millipedes, which constitute a separate class.

The centipede body is divided into well-marked segments, the number of which varies from 12 to more than 100. The head, which is covered by a flat shield above, bears a pair of antennae, usually of considerable length and consisting of from 12 to more than 100 joints; a pair of small, strong, toothed, and bristly mandibles; and a pair of underjaws, usually with palps. The next, limblike appendages are followed by a modified pair of legs with strong joints, terminating in a sharp claw into which a poison gland opens. These appendages are used for seizing and killing prey. The two legs on each other segment are usually seven-jointed, sometimes bearing spurs and glands, and are generally clawed.

The relatively large brain is connected with a ventral chain of ganglia. Compound eyes occur in one family, and simple eyes or none at all in many. The feelers, certain bristles, and portions of the skin are also sensory. The alimentary canal is straight, and the heart is a chambered dorsal vessel. Tracheae, or air tubes, open on the sides of the body and are connected to one another on each side. Most centipedes measure about 2.5 to 5 cm (about 1 to 2 in) in length, but some tropical species grow to about 30 cm (about 12 in).

Centipedes are nocturnal and remain under stones or wood during the day. They are all carnivorous. One genus bears live young; the others lay eggs.

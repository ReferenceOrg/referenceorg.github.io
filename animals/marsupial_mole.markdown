Marsupial Mole, small, burrowing marsupial that lives in the hot, sandy soils of northwestern and southern Australia. Because it spends most of its time underground, the marsupial mole is rarely seen—scientists were not aware of its existence until 1858—but it is believed to be fairly common and widely distributed in its range. 

Marsupial moles average 66 g (2 oz) in weight and measure between 9 and 18 cm (about 3.5 and 7 in) in length, not including the tail, which is usually less than 2.6 cm (1 in) long, hairless, and conical in shape. Their tube-shaped bodies are covered with silky fur, which ranges in color from pinkish white to golden red. Marsupial moles are blind; they have only tiny nonfunctioning eyes, measuring no more than 1 mm (0.04 in), that are totally covered with fur. They lack external ears and have a shieldlike plate covering their nose, which protects them as they dig. Their limbs are short and strong and their feet have long, flattened claws that act as scoops for digging. 

To find its chief foods, insects and worms, the marsupial mole burrows in the sandy soil about 8 cm (3 in) below the surface with a fast, fluid motion, which is often described as sand swimming. Using the spadelike claws on its front feet, the mole scoops away dirt as its snout pushes forward. Little trace of the marsupial mole’s activity remains after it is gone because its back feet push the dirt in such a way that it fills the tunnel behind the animal as it burrows. 

Like other marsupials, marsupial moles are born premature. They spend the early part of their lives in their mother’s abdominal pouch, which opens backward to prevent sand from entering. Little else is known about the reproductive behavior of these shy, solitary animals.

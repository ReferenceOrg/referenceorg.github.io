Wallaby, small-to-medium-sized kangaroo. The wallaby is a marsupial (pouched mammal) and is native to Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and some of the neighboring islands. Wallabies can live in a variety of environments from open, grassy plains to brush country and rocky hillsides.

Wallabies are gray or brown in color. Like the larger kangaroo, the wallaby has a stout, elongated tail, very large hind legs and feet, and small forepaws. The animal uses its long tail as a prop when standing and as a means of balance during its leaps. The wallaby's long head tapers to a rounded muzzle; its ears are large, long, and deerlike.

Some species of wallabies are sociable and live in colonies, while others are solitary except during the mating season. Many of the animals are nocturnal. Most wallabies sleep in small depressions in the ground known as “forms”; others live among rocks or brush. The wallaby feeds on grass, leaves, and other vegetation.

Females usually have only one young at a time. Although born in an incomplete state of development, the animal manages to find its way to its mother's pouch, where it attaches itself to a nipple. It remains in the pouch until fully developed.

There are many kinds of wallabies. The hare wallaby lives on the plains and has many harelike habits. The rock wallaby is a beautifully marked, slender animal with a total length of 84 cm (33 in). Its feet are padded to prevent slipping on smooth rocks after a long leap. The nail-tailed wallaby has a horny projection, or nail, on the tip of its tail. The scrub wallabies include many variously colored species. The quokka differs from other wallabies in the shortness of its tail, which is less than one-third of its total length. The bush wallaby is 76 cm (30 in) in length, with a tail of equal length. The bush wallaby group includes several beautifully marked, slender species with a variety of popular names, such as black-tailed and black-gloved wallaby. The gazelle-faced wallaby is a mountain species living at elevations of 3000 m (10,000 ft). In spite of its common name, it should be included with the kangaroos, to which it is more closely related.

Scientific classification: Wallabies are members of the family Macropodidae in the order Marsupialia. Hare wallabies make up the genus Lagorchestes; rock wallabies, the genus Petrogale; nail-tailed wallabies, the genus Onychogalea; scrub wallabies, the genus Thylogale; quokkas, the genus Setonyx; bush wallabies, the genus Wallabia; and gazelle-faced wallabies, the genus Dorcopsis.

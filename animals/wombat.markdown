Wombat, burrowing marsupial native to Australia and Tasmania. The teeth of wombats grow continuously, and, as in rodents, a single pair of chisel-like incisors is found in each jaw. The animals have long claws that are adapted for digging, and they live in burrows, from which they emerge at night to feed on grasses and other plants. The young are born singly once a year, and each is carried in the mother's pouch for about six months.

The common wombat of southern Australia is the largest, attaining a length of 70 to 120 cm (28 to 47 in). It is stocky; has a short, stubby tail; and its thick, coarse fur varies in color from yellow to black. It has a placid disposition and is easily domesticated. From the same area are the two species of hairy-nosed wombat, which differ from the common species in having longer, pointed ears; a hairy muzzle; and soft, silky fur.

Wombats have been nearly exterminated in some areas because it is thought that they damage crops and fences; that their burrows are a danger to livestock; and that rabbits, an introduced pest, may live in wombat burrows. One of the hairy-nosed wombats is considered an endangered species.

Scientific classification: Wombats make up the family Vombatidae. The common wombat is classified as Vombatus ursinus. The two species of hairy-nosed wombats are Lasiorhinus latifrons and Lasiorhinus krefftii; the latter is considered an endangered species.

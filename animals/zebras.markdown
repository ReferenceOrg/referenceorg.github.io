### Introduction

Zebra, member of the horse family with an eye-catching coat of black and white stripes. Zebras are found only in Africa, but their remarkable markings make them among the most familiar mammals in the world. There are three species of zebras, each with a distinctive stripe pattern: Grévy’s zebra, the mountain zebra, and the plains zebra (also known as Burchell’s zebra).

Zebras are members of the family Equidae, which also includes horses and asses. The earliest known ancestor of the animals in this family was a small animal called Hyracotherium, or more commonly, Eohippus, which lived 60 million years ago during the Pleistocene Epoch. Animals known to be the direct ancestors of the modern horse, ass, and zebra appeared in Europe, Africa, and Asia about 4 million years ago during the Pliocene Epoch.

Like other members of the horse family, zebras are primarily grazing animals. They obtain their food energy from coarse grass, leaves, and shoots. Zebras face many predators, particularly lions and hyenas, but over the last 200 years humans have posed a greater threat to their survival. The quagga, a zebra with stripes on its head and neck, but often none on its sides and hindquarters, lived in southern Africa until the 1870s, when it was hunted to extinction. Today, both Grévy’s zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered by hunting and habitat loss.

### Range and Habitat

The water needs of each zebra species vary, and this factor helps to explain differences in where they live.

Grévy’s zebra is the best at coping with drought conditions. It lives in grasslands and thorny scrublands on the borders of northern Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, a harsh region scorched by high temperatures. During the dry season when rivers, streams, and other surface waters often dry up, Grévy’s zebras survive by using their hooves to dig waterholes in riverbed sand.

The mountain zebra lives in the high ground of South Africa, and in the coastal hills of Namibia and Angola. Like Grévy’s zebra, it is also drought-adapted and will dig for water when supplies become scarce. However, the mountain zebra survives the dry season largely by migrating to higher ground, where moisture condenses in the cooler air to form rain or snow.

Compared to the Grévy’s zebra and the mountain zebra, the plains zebra has a much broader range. It lives throughout the grasslands, savanna, and scrub of East Africa, reaching as far as Angola in the west. Unlike its two relatives, the plains zebra needs access to surface water every day, and in some places it must migrate in step with the seasons to find places with enough water to drink.

### Physical Description

Although zebras are similar in shape to horses, they are generally smaller, with upright manes and shorter tails. The mountain zebra is the smallest species of zebras. Adults average about 1.2 m (4 ft) high at the shoulders. Adult plains zebras are only slightly larger, averaging about 1.4 m (4.6 ft) at the shoulder. Grévy’s zebra is the largest species, with adults standing about 1.5 m (5 ft) high at the shoulder. The plains and mountain zebras weigh 290 to 340 kg (640 to 750 lb) and the Grévy’s zebra weighs up to 450 kg (990 lb), which is about the same weight as a typical riding horse. In plains and mountain zebras, the males are slightly larger than the females, but in Grévy’s zebras the sexes weigh about the same.

Like horses, zebras have keen hearing. They turn their ears and large eyes toward the source of a sound to quickly pick up any movements or noises that might indicate danger. The position of their ears also helps to show their mood, another characteristic that zebras and horses share. For instance, ears that flick back and forth indicate the zebra is distressed. Their sense of smell is not particularly well developed, but like most grassland mammals, zebras are very sensitive to smoke, a useful feature in habitats where lightning strikes sometimes start grassfires.

Zebras have chisel-shaped incisor teeth at the front of both jaws, and large molars or cheek teeth that grind up food before it is swallowed. Compared to digestion in ruminants (animals that regurgitate partially digested food and chew it again, such as buffaloes and antelope), zebra digestion is relatively inefficient in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. To make up for their inefficient digestion, zebras spend over half their time eating. 

#### Stripes

Each zebra species has a different stripe pattern, and no two individuals within a species have exactly the same markings. The Grévy’s zebra has narrow stripes set closely together. Horizontal stripes on the haunches, shoulders, and legs are short and fine and extend all the way down the legs to the hooves. The mountain zebra has wider stripes than the Grévy’s zebra, particularly on its rump, while the plains zebra has the widest stripes of all. Of the three species, the plains zebra is the only one with stripes that wrap around from the back to the belly; in the other two species, the underside is completely or mainly white. The plains zebra is also the only species that sometimes has faint gray markings called shadow stripes between the main black stripes on its sides.

Because zebras spend so much time eating, they are an easy target for predators, and some zoologists have suggested that zebra stripes act as a protective camouflage. According to this theory, their bold markings break up their body outline, making them difficult to see from far away. Another explanation for zebra markings is that in a herd, zebra stripes confuse would-be attackers by making it hard for them to single out an individual animal from a backdrop of constantly shifting stripes. 

To many experts, a more convincing explanation for zebra stripes lies in their social life. Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly gregarious, and they constantly seek out each other’s company. Their stripes may act like an identity badge, helping individual animals stay in contact with one another. Very occasionally, unstriped zebras do occur, and these animals tend to stay isolated from their own kind—suggesting to some scientists that zebra stripes act more as a way to develop social relationships than as a form of camouflage.

#### Gaits

Zebras use the same gaits as horses—that is, they walk, trot, canter, and gallop, switching easily from one gait to another, like a car smoothly changing gear. Zebras walk most of the time, typically reserving the gallop for emergencies. They can reach a top speed of about 55 km/h (34 mph), making zebras slower than most horses, but their stamina helps them outdistance enemies provided they get a head start. If zebras are cornered, they kick out with their back hooves, delivering a powerful blow that can send hyenas and young lions flying through the air.

#### Life Span

Captive zebras have lived into their late 30s. Life expectancy in the wild, where predators abound, is probably not much more than 12 years.

### Social Behavior

Like horses, zebras have large brains and a wide variety of social behaviors. Although they cannot match the overall intelligence of mammals that hunt, zebras interact with each other in complex ways.

Zebras usually live in groups known as herds, but the social structure of these groups depends on the species. The plains zebra and mountain zebra form small family units, consisting of up to six mares (adult females) and their foals (young), under the leadership of a stallion (adult male).

Once a stallion has assembled a group of mares, it faces the constant threat of being displaced by a more powerful rival. When an intruder does appear, the resident stallion issues a challenge by touching noses or rubbing shoulders with the rival. If the rival male does not give way, a fight breaks out, with the two stallions biting each other’s neck or legs, and as a last resort, kicking with their back legs. Unlike some courtship contests in the animal world, these fights are as dangerous as they look, and severe injuries can result.

The family units of the plains and mountain zebra are very stable, and although a younger rival may eventually oust the stallion, the mares often remain in the group for life. Within the group, there is a strict order of seniority by age, which shows itself when the animals are on the move. The oldest mare is first in line, followed by her foals, and then by the other mares and foals, with the youngest coming last. Finally, the stallion brings up the rear.

By contrast, among Grévy’s zebras, there are no permanent bonds between the adult animals. The chief social unit is a nursing mare and one or two of her foals. Although the mare will often associate with other adults, there is no order of rank, and each mare comes and goes as she pleases. However, as with the other two species, the behavior of Grévy’s zebras is affected by their food supply. If food is scarce, the animals spread out, but if it is abundant in one particular place, hundreds of Grévy’s zebras may converge to feed, giving the impression of a single herd.

For all zebras, physical contact plays an important part in daily life. Pairs of adults, as well as mothers and foals, often groom each other. They stand side by side, with the head of one zebra adjacent to the tail of its partner in order to nibble each other’s fur. Zebras also rest in this position, because it enables them to use their tails to keep flies away from each other’s faces. This stance has another advantage: Together, the two animals have a complete 360° view of their surroundings. Zebras also signal to each other with body language and sounds. Lowered ears, for example, show that a zebra is likely to kick, while a snort shows that it is alarmed. Domesticated horses behave in exactly the same way.

Zebras adapt well to life in captivity, and make popular zoo animals. Although they are less cooperative than horses, they can be tamed and trained to pull carriages, but they are very difficult to ride.

### Feeding, Sleeping, and Migration

Like many other plant-eating mammals, zebras do most of their feeding early and late in the day, resting during the midday heat. During the day zebras sometimes sleep on their feet, as horses do, but at night they often lie down. For any animal, sleeping is potentially hazardous because it offers predators an opportunity to attack. For this reason, a zebra will only sleep if one or more of its neighbors is fully awake to act as a sentry. Zebras use a similar system when they feed—while some animals have their heads down munching on grass, others are on the lookout for danger.

During the course of a day, a zebra herd may wander 20 km (12 mi) or more in search of food, usually returning to the same resting place each evening. But in some parts of Africa, such as Tanzania, the dry season prompts a much longer annual migration in the company of thousands of gnus and gazelles, creating one of the greatest wildlife spectacles in the world. 

### Reproduction

Female zebras can give birth to their first foal when they are just three years old, and from then onward they produce young at intervals of between 18 months and three years. For males, breeding often does not begin until age five or six.

After a gestation period of about 12 months, female zebras typically give birth to a single foal. The newborn foal feeds on its mother’s milk for up to a year. This 12-month period is by far the most dangerous in a zebra’s life, because although foals can run soon after birth, they lack the speed and endurance to escape lions and other predators.

Grévy’s zebra mares look after their foals without the help of stallions. In plains zebras and mountain zebras the stallion helps to protect all the foals in its family unit, and also their mothers. If a foal wanders too far from the rest of the group, the stallion will round it up and shepherd it back to safety. Despite the constant vigilance of their parents, only about 50 percent of zebra foals manage to survive their first year.

### Conservation Status

Zebras have been hunted for thousands of years, both for their meat and for their hides. Primitive hunting techniques probably had only a minor impact on zebra populations, but the introduction of firearms by European settlers made zebras much more vulnerable. During the 19th century the quagga, a species of zebra that lived in South Africa, was hunted to extinction. The last captive specimen, held in the Amsterdam Zoo, died in 1883, several years after the species had vanished in the wild.

Both the Grévy’s zebra and the mountain zebra are listed as endangered on the Red List of Threatened Species, prepared by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), a nongovernmental organization that compiles global information on endangered species. With a total population of less than 10,000, the Grévy’s zebra is threatened both by hunting and by livestock that compete with it for water and food. Its range has shrunk dramatically, and it is now so small that environmental hazards, such as drought, can easily affect the entire species.

A distinctive subspecies of the mountain zebra that lives in South Africa, commonly known as the cape mountain zebra, has come perilously close to extinction in the 20th century. During the 1930s, the population of cape mountain zebras fell to less than 100 animals. Several decades of conservation work, including the establishment of the Mountain Zebra National Park in South Africa for the preservation of the mountain zebra, has helped the population rise to about 700 animals. Further north, in Namibia and Angola, mountain zebras are more numerous, with an estimated 25,000 animals, although these populations are also threatened by hunting and loss of habitat. 

For the plains zebra, the situation is much less alarming. It is the most abundant wild member of the horse family, with a wide range and numbers probably exceeding 750,000. However, on a local level, the plains zebra is still threatened by hunting and by habitat change from ranching and other kinds of farming.

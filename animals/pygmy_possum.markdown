Pygmy Possum, common name for members of a family of mouse-sized marsupials native to New Guinea, Australia, and Tasmania. Most pygmy possums are tree-dwellers that live in rain forests, eucalyptus forests, and shrub lands. An exception to this is the mountain pygmy possum, which lives among boulders in alpine sites at elevations of up to 2230 m (7140 ft).

Pygmy possums range in length from 6 to 12 cm (2 to 5 in), not including the tail, which is 7 to 18 cm (3 to 7 in) long. They weigh 8 to 60 g (0.3 to 2.1 oz) and have large protruding eyes, and short rounded ears. Their silky fur is brown except on their bellies, where it is white. The lightly furred tail is prehensile—that is, it is capable of grasping branches and other objects. Pygmy possums are good climbers, using their tails to help them move gracefully and quickly through trees and bushes in search of food. One species, commonly known as the pygmy glider, has narrow membranes of skin along the sides of its body, which it uses to glide distances of up to 20 m (66 ft) as it travels from tree to tree.

Pygmy possums eat a varied diet consisting of fruit, nectar, pollen, and insects. They are active at night and they return to their nest at daybreak. Pygmy possums nest in hollow logs or build nests of grass or bark. They often curl up with one another in their nests, probably to help conserve body heat. During cold weather, pygmy possums may become dormant for several days, but they do not truly hibernate.

Like all marsupials, pygmy possums are born immature. They spend the first part of their lives in their mother’s abdominal pouch. Among mountain pygmy possums, gestation lasts 14 to 16 days and is followed by a 22-day pouch period. Mountain pygmy possum litters consist of up to four young weighing less than 1 g (.03 oz) each.

The known predators of pygmy possums include foxes and domestic cats. Mountain pygmy possums are also threatened by tourism, because their small range coincides with an Australian ski region. The World Conservation Monitoring Centre classifies the mountain pygmy possum as an endangered species.

The mountain pygmy possum is classified as Burramys parvus, and the pygmy glider as Acrobates pygmaeus.
